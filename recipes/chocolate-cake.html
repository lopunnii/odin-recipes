    <h1>Best-Ever Chocolate Cake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite recipe ever for chocolate cake and is always a big hit. This cake is intensely chocolate and unbelieveably moist.</p>
    <p>I sometimes like to add extra coffee into the cake and buttercream to turn it into a delicious mocha cake.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h4>For the cake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ cups (312.5g) + 1 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups (600g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (86g) + 1 tbsp Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking soda</li>
        <l1>1½ tsp baking powder</l1>
        <li>1½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs (at room temp)</li>
        <li>1½ cups (360ml) buttermilk (at room temp)</li>
        <li>1½ cups (355.5ml) strong black coffee, hot</li>
        <li>¾ cup (163.5 ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4½ tsp vanilla extract
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the chocolate frosting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (226.8 g) semisweet chocolate (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cups (454 g) unsalted butter (room temp)</li>
        <li>5 cups (600 g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <h4>Cake base</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper, 
            grease the parchment, then flour the insides of the pans, tapping out excess; set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer (or large mixing bowl if you're using a hand mixer), sift together the flour, sugar, 
            cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, coffee, 
            oil and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix for 2 minutes on medium speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of 
            the bowl and mix for an additional 20 seconds (the batter will be very thin).</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among prepared pans. Bake for 20 minutes and rotate the pans in the oven. Continue to bake 
            until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out almost clean (with a few moist crumbs), about 
            12 more minutes. Cool the cakes (in the pans) on wire racks for 20 minutes, then carefully turn them out onto cooling 
            racks to cool completely. [Make-Ahead Tip! At this point you can wrap the layers in plastic wrap and keep at room 
            temperature for up to 1 day, or refrigerate for up to 3 days before frosting and serving. You can also wrap in aluminum 
            foil and freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before frosting and serving.]</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chocolate frosting</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chopped chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second increments on 50% power, stirring after 
            each, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, using the whisk attachment of your stand mixer, whip the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes, stopping 
            to scrape the bowl once or twice.</li>
        <li>Reduce the speed to medium-low and gradually add the powdered sugar. Once all of the powdered sugar is incorporated, add 
            the vanilla, mixing until incorporated. Add the melted chocolate and whip at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 
            about 2 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed to incorporate all of the chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble the cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place one of the cake layers on a serving platter or cake stand and spread 1 cup of the frosting over the top in an even layer. 
            Place another cake layer on top of the frosting and spread with another 1 cup of the frosting. Place the last cake layer on top 
            of the frosting upside-down, then frost the top and sides of the cake and decorate as desired. The cake can be kept, covered, 
            at room temperature for up to 4 days. You can also freeze the cake, well-wrapped in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, for up 
            to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
