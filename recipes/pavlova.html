    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pavlova is a popular desert from New Zealand. It has a crisp, meringue-like outer shell but is soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
    <p>It is said that the recipe was created in honor of Anna Pavlova, a Russian ballerina, when she toured New Zealand and Australia in the 1920's.</p>
    <p>The pavlova is light and airy - just like a ballerina's dance performance, hence the name.</p>
